# Password Manager using Tkinter

It is a Python-based application built using Tkinter for the GUI. 
It allows users to generate strong passwords consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols. 
The generated password is automatically copied to the clipboard for convenience. Users can securely store website 
credentials, including Website Name, Email/Username, and Password, in a text file. The application features a simple and 
intuitive interface with labeled entry fields and buttons for generating and saving passwords. The "Add" button ensures that
credentials are saved only after user confirmation. Additionally, an image logo is integrated 
into the UI for better aesthetics. The password storage file is updated in append mode, allowing continuous data 
entry without overwriting previous credentials.
